Maximus is one of the Roman army's most capable and trusted generals and a key advisor to the emperor. As Marcus' devious son Commodus ascends to the throne, Maximus is set to be executed. He escapes, but is captured by slave traders. Renamed Spaniard and forced to become a gladiator, Maximus must battle to the death with other men for the amusement of paying audiences. His battle skills serve him well, and he becomes one of the most famous and admired men to fight in the Colosseum. Determined to avenge himself against the man who took away his freedom and laid waste to his family, Maximus believes that he can use his fame and skill in the ring to avenge the loss of his family and former glory. As the gladiator begins to challenge his rule, Commodus decides to put his own fighting mettle to the test by squaring off with Maximus in a battle to the death.",

Watson was cast as Hermione at the age of nine, having previously acted only in school plays. From 2001 to 2011, she starred in eight Harry Potter films alongside Daniel Radcliffe and Rupert Grint. Watson's work on the Harry Potter series has earned her several awards and more than £10 million.\n\nShe made her modelling debut for Burberry's Autumn/Winter campaign in 2009. In 2007, Watson announced her involvement in two non-Harry Potter productions: the television adaptation of the novel Ballet Shoes and an animated film, The Tale of Despereaux. Ballet Shoes was broadcast on 26 December 2007 to an audience of 5.2 million, and The Tale of Despereaux, based on the novel by Kate DiCamillo, was released in 2008 and grossed over US $70 million in worldwide sales. In 2012, she starred in Stephen Chbosky's film adaptation of The Perks of Being a Wallflower, and was cast in the role of Ila in Darren Aronofsky's biblical epic Noah.\n\nDescription above from the Wikipedia article Emma Watson, licensed under CC-BY-SA, full list of contributors on Wikipedia.",

McGregor studied drama for a year at Kirkcaldly in Fife, then enrolled at London's Guildhall School of Music and Drama for a three-year course. He studied alongside Daniel Craig and Alistair McGowan among others, and left right before graduating after snagging the role of Private Mick Hopper in Dennis Potter's 1993 six-part Channel 4 series \"Lipstick on Your Collar\" (1993).\n\nHis first notable role was that of Alex Law in Shallow Grave (1994), directed by Danny Boyle, written by John Hodge and produced by Andrew MacDonald. This was followed by The Pillow Book (1996) and Trainspotting (1996), the latter of which brought him to the public's attention.\n\nHe is now one of the most critically acclaimed actors of his generation, and portrays Obi-wan Kenobi in the first three Star Wars episodes. McGregor is married to French production designer Eve Mavrakis, whom he met while working on the TV show \"Kavanagh QC\" (1995). They married in France in the summer of 1995 and have two daughters, Clara Mathilde and Esther Rose. McGregor has formed a production company with friends Jonny Lee Miller, Sean Pertwee, Jude Law and Sadie Frost. Called Natural Nylon, they hope it will make innovative films that do not conform to Hollywood standards.",

    "biography": "Alterio es de ascendencia italiana, sus padres eran originarios de Carpinone, Nápoles. Al finalizar sus estudios de arte dramático, crea la compañía Nuevo Teatro, que le supone ser un renovador de la escena argentina de la década de los '60. Su debut en los escenarios se produjo mucho antes, en 1948, cuando protagonizóProhibido suicidarse en primavera una obra escrita en 1937 por Alejandro Casona. En 1950 fundó la compañía Nuevo Teatro, la que tuvo a pleno rendimiento hasta 1968. Pero se hizo famoso sobre todo por sus trabajos en el cine que empezaron en 1965 con Todo sol es amargo, deAlfredo Mathé. En los siguientes años Alterio intervino en algunas de las mejores películas de la entonces nueva generación de cineastas argentinos. Ha hecho colaboraciones con Fernando Ayalaen Argentino hasta la muerte, 1970, Juan José Jusid en La fidelidad, 1970, Héctor Olivera en La venganza del Beto Sánchez, 1972 y La Patagonia rebelde, 1974, Oso de Plata en Berlín. Y el más destacado de ellos, Leopoldo Torre Nilsson en El santo de la espada, 1969, La maffia, 1971 y Los siete locos, 1972. En 1975, mientras se encontraba en España, fue amenazado de muerte por la Triple A,2 por lo que decide no regresar a su país, y residir desde entonces en España, donde consiguió también la nacionalidad española. Desde 1975, Alterio también ha tenido participación en muchas producciones españolas, dejando memorables creaciones en A un dios desconocido (1977) de Jaime Chávarri, con la que obtuvo el premio al mejor actor en el Festival de San Sebastián; El crimen de Cuenca (1979) de Pilar Miró; El nido (1980) de Jaime de Armiñán, película nominada al Óscar y premio al mejor actor de la Asociación de Cronistas de Nueva York; o Don Juan en los infiernos (1991) y El detective y la muerte (1994); ambas películas de Gonzalo Suárez. Sin embargo no dejó de participar en numerosas películas de su país de origen. Curiosamente, él fue uno de los protagonistas principales en cuatro de las primeras cinco películas de ese país que llegaron a ser candidatas en la instancia final del Óscar a la mejor película de habla no inglesa, e incluso una de ellas lo ganó. Dichas películas fueron: La tregua (1974), Camila (1984), La historia oficial (1985) (que ganó el premio), y El hijo de la novia (2001). Sus hijos, Ernesto Alterio y Malena Alterio también son actores. En Vientos de agua, una serie de televisión hispano argentina, de 13 episodios, que narra el fenómeno de la inmigración a través del exilio de un español hacia la Argentina, huyendo de problemas políticos, y el retorno de su hijo en 2001 debido a la crisis económica de ese país, actuaron tanto él como su hijo (en realidad ambos hacían el mismo papel, sólo que Héctor realizó las escenas en que el protagonista aparece de anciano, y Ernesto las de joven, razón por la cual no se cruzaron nunca en el desarrollo de la serie). En 2004 recibió el Goya de Honor y en 2010 el Cóndor de Plata a la trayectoria.",
